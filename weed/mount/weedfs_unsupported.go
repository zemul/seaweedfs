 * Copy a range of data from one file to anotherNiels de Vos, 4 years ago: â€¢ libfuse: add copy_file_range() support

 * Performs an optimized copy between two file descriptors without the
 * additional cost of transferring data through the FUSE kernel module
 * to user space (glibc) and then back into the FUSE filesystem again.
 *
 * In case this method is not implemented, applications are expected to
 * fall back to a regular file copy.   (Some glibc versions did this
 * emulation automatically, but the emulation has been removed from all
 * glibc release branches.)
